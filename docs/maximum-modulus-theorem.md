# Maximum Modulus Theorem

This is a celebrated results in complex analysis, it says that the maximum of non-constant analytics function occur on the boundary of a domain.

!!! success "Maximum Modulus Theorem"
    Let $f$ is analytic in a connected domain $\Omega$, then the maximum value of $\vert f(z) \vert$ occur on the boundary of the domain, i.e., $\partial \Omega$.

**Proof:** In order to prove this theorem first we will prove this result for a disc stated as follows

!!! success "Local Mean Value Theorem"
    If $f$ is analytic on a disc of radius $r$ with centre $a$, such that $f(a)$
