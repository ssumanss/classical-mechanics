# Welcome to complex analysis course

This page is dedicated to the course of classical mechanics taught at the university department of mathematics, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Bhagalpur.

## Syllabus

- Generalized coordinate
- Method of virtual work
- D'Alemberts principle
- Lagrange equation of motion
- Genralized momentum
- Calculus of Variation
- Hamilton's principle
- Hamilton's equation of motion
- Phase space

## Objectives

The course ==classical mechanics== focussed on the study of new formalism of Newtonian mechanics given by Lagrange and Hamlton. Lagrange found that the motion can be derived in any coordinate system, while Hamilton give a principle which describes the motion of all classical mechanics in one line. Hamilton's principle is turn out to be extended in other areas of physics like electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. 

- [ ] Identify degree of freedom
- [ ] Setup a generalized coordinate
- [ ] Represent the position, velocity, etc., in terms of generalized coordinate
- [ ] Esteblish Lagrange equation of motion
- [ ] Importance of Hamilton's principle
- [ ] Identify genralized momentum and cyclic coordinate
- [ ] Find Hamilton's equation of motion
