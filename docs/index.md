# Welcome to complex analysis course

This page is dedicated to the course of complex analysis taught in the university department of mathematics, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Bhagalpur.

## Syllabus

- Contour Integration
- Cauchy Integral Forumula and Related Theorems
- Power and Laurents Series
- Sigularites
- Rouches theorem

## Course Objectives

The course ==Complex Analysis== focussed on the study of properties of complex functions. This is the second course on complex analysis in TMBU, Bhagalpur. The first course mainly introduce the concept of differentiability and analyticity in complex domains. Here we will discuss the integration in the sense of complex functions.

- [ ] Understand contour integration
- [ ] Apply Cauchy integral formula
- [ ] Import results based on CIF
- [ ] Ability to represent complex function as Power and Laurents series
- [ ] Understand different type of singularity 
- [ ] Finding the integraton along closed contour
